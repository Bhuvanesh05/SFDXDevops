To copy the task
================
- task: CopyFiles@2
    displayName: Copy Saleforce files to staging directory
    inputs:
      SourceFolder: $(Build.SourcesDirectory)
      Contents: >-
        Assets/**

        delta/**
      TargetFolder: $(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)

path directory
==============

 Utility: 

Source folder:

$(Build.SourcesDirectory)

Contents:

/$(BuildConfiguration)//?(*.exe|*.dll|*.pdb)

Target folder:

$(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)


 Utility: Publish Build Artifacts

Path to publish:
$(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)

TIPS:
=====

On Azure Pipelines and some versions of TFS, two different variables point to the staging directory: Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory and Build.StagingDirectory. These are interchangeable.

The directory referenced by Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory is cleaned up after each build.

Deleting a build that published Artifacts to a file share will result in the deletion of all Artifacts in that UNC path.
